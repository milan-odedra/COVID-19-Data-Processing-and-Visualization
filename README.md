How to use our code:
First, open main.py. Double check if the files are in your folder and the paths are correct.
Then run main.py.
Now you should have the GUI infront of you. By clicking on the buttons on the right you call our functionalities. Some have a UI in the terminal in order to function so look out for that.
That's all, have fun!
